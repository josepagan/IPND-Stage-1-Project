# IPND-Stage-1-Project
Website featuring HTML and CSS, using flexbox for layout

On the css file I have pulled the img atribute: from-image, since it is yet not widely suported. 
Therefore i have created the upsidedown class which uses the transform argument, images that require to berotated can be easily tagged on the html file with this class
